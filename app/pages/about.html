    <h3>
      Server-side Javascript
    </h3>
    <p>
      Though I'm a fan of several programming languages, nothing is as
      prevalent today as JS. I jumped on the Node.js train early on
      and have enjoyed the ever-evolving (sometimes chaotic) ecosystem
      ever since: monolithic web APIs, serverless architecture,
      new runtimes, et. all.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Technical Writing
    </h3>
    <p>
      Taking complex software systems down to their fundamentals to
      effectively explain how something works and how to use it.
      Whether it's a guided blog post or technical documentation, I
      like to create reference material to help other developers
      understand a piece of software.
    </p>

    <h3>
      System Integration
    </h3>
    <p>
      Connecting the dots with reliable and pliable pipelines. ETL,
      warehousing, data portability, reporting, real-time updates.
      From one platform to another. Custom or off-the-shelf, I make
      sure orgs have the right information in the right place.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Interactive Applications
    </h3>
    <p>
      It can't all be back-end magic. At the end of the day, humans
      are why we build things and they need to be able to use our
      software. I enjoy building interactive programs of all sizes.
      From robust customer-facing apps to slim command line interfaces
      for developers.
