			<h3>
				Server-side Javascript
			</h3>
			<p>
				Though I'm a fan of several programming languages, nothing is as
				prevalent today as JS. I jumped on the Node.js train early on
				and have enjoyed the ever-evolving (sometimes chaotic) ecosystem
				ever since: monolithic web APIs, serverless architecture,
				new runtimes, et. all.

			<h3>
				Technical Writing
			</h3>
			<p>
				Taking complex software systems down to their fundamentals to
				effectively explain how something works and how to use it.
				Whether it's a guided blog post or technical documentation, I
				like to create reference material to help other developers
				understand a piece of software.

			<h3>
				System Integration
			</h3>
			<p>
				Connecting the dots with reliable and pliable pipelines. ETL,
				warehousing, data portability, reporting, real-time updates.
				From one platform to another. Custom or off-the-shelf, I make
				sure orgs have the right information in the right place.
			</p>

			<h3>
				Interactive Applications
			</h3>
			<p>
				It can't all be back-end magic. At the end of the day, humans
				are why we build things and they need to be able to use our
				software. I enjoy building interactive programs of all sizes.
				From robust customer-facing apps to slim command line interfaces
				for developers.
