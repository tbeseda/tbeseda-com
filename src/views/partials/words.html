    <h3 class="text-gray-100 text-xl font-semibold mb-3">System Integration</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-300">
      Connecting the dots with reliable and pliable pipelines. ETL, warehousing, data
      portability, reporting, real-time updates. From one platform to another. Custom or
      off-the-shelf, I make sure orgs have the right information in the right place.

    <h3 class="text-gray-100 text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Server-side Javascript</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-300">
      Though I'm a fan of several programming languages, nothing is as prevalent today as
      JS. I jumped on the Node.js train early on and have enjoyed the ever-evolving
      (sometimes chaotic) ecosystem ever since: monolithic Express APIs, serverless
      architecture, Typescript, Deno, et. all.

    <h3 class="text-gray-100 text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Technical Writing</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-300">
      Taking complex software systems down to their fundamentals to effectively explain how
      something works and how to use it. Whether it's a guided blog post or technical
      documentation, I like to create reference material to help other developers understand
      a piece of software.

    <h3 class="text-gray-100 text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Interactive Applications</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-300">
      It can't all be back-end magic. At the end of the day, humans are why we build things
      and they need to be able to use our software. I enjoy building interactive programs of
      all sizes. From robust customer-facing apps to slim command line interfaces for
      developers.
